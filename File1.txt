git init

If you don’t want to clone an existing repository, 
you can create a new local repository in the directory 
you are currently in with this command.

git status

It’s a beneficial command that will tell you everything you need to know about the current branch and its files.
This is used to display the state of the repository and staging area. 
It allows you to see the tracked and untracked files and changes. 
You can also see if the branch is up to date or if there is anything to commit.

git add

When a file is created or changed on your local repository,
and you want to update your remote repository,
first use this command to ad the file to the staging area to be committed. 
If you changed multiple files and wish to add them all at once, after “git add”,”type””-A”. 
Git add does not change the remote repository; it only adds the files to a staging area.

git clone 

This command creates a copy of the latest version of a repository on your computer in the directory you are currently in. 
The original repository can be local or remote such as a GitHub repository. 
GitHub offers a few different ways to clone a repository; a simple way is by HTTP.
