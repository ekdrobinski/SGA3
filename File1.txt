git init

If you don’t want to clone an existing repository, 
you can create a new local repository in the directory 
you are currently in with this command.

git status

It’s a beneficial command that will tell you everything you need to know about the current branch and its files.
This is used to display the state of the repository and staging area. 
It allows you to see the tracked and untracked files and changes. 
You can also see if the branch is up to date or if there is anything to commit.
